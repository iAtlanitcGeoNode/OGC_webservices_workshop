      "Large Marine Ecosystems are regions of ocean space encompassing coastal areas from river basins and estuaries to the seaward boundaries of continental shelves and the outer margins of the major current systems. They are relatively large regions on the order of 200,000 km2 or greater, characterized by distinct: (1) bathymetry, (2) hydrography, (3) productivity, and (4) trophically dependent populations. On a global scale, 64 LMEs produce 95 percent of the world's annual marine fishery biomass yields. Within their waters, most of the global ocean pollution, overexploitation, and coastal habitat alteration occur. For 33 of the 64 LMES, studies have been conducted of the principal driving forces affecting changes in biomass yields. They have been peer- reviewed and published in ten volumes (http://www.lme.noaa.gov). Based on lessons learned from the LME case studies, a five module strategy has been developed to provide science-based information for the monitoring, assessment, and management of LMES. The modules are focused on LME: (1) productivity, (2) fish and fisheries, (3) pollution and health, (4) socioeconomics, and (5) governance.\n",

      "The complex oceanic currents in this part of the Atlantic result in the widespread occurrence of strongly oxygen-depleted subsurface water masses. Despite such seemingly unfavourable conditions, diverse benthic ecosystems thrive along the Angolan continental slope, including cold-water corals and cold seep ecosystems. While the corals are fuelled by organic matter filtering down from surface plankton productivity, the cold seep ecosystems obtain their energy from natural methane emissions at the seafloor.\n",

      "We used environmental niche modelling along with the best available species occurrence data and environmental parameters to model habitat suitability for key cold-water coral and commercially important deep-sea fish species under present-day (1951-2000) environmental conditions and to forecast changes under severe, high emissions future (2081-2100) climate projections (RCP8.5 scenario) for the North Atlantic Ocean (from 18°N to 76°N and 36°E to 98°W). This dataset contains a set of terrain (static in time) and environmental (dynamic in time) variables were used as candidate predictors of present-day (1951-2000) distribution and to forecast future (2081-2100) changes. All predictor variables were projected with the Albers equal-area conical projection centred in the middle of the study area.  The terrain variable depth was extracted from a bathymetry grid built from two data sources: the EMODnet Digital Terrain Model (EMODnet, 2018) and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO 2014; Weatherall et al., 2015). Slope (in degrees) was derived from the final bathymetry grid using the Raster package in R (Hijmans, 2016) and the Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) was computed using the Benthic Terrain Model 3.0 tool in ArcGIS 10.1 with an inner radius of 3 and an outer radius of 25 grid cells. In order to avoid extreme values, BPI was standardized using the scale function from the Raster package. Environmental variables of present-day and future conditions, including particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 100-m depth (epc100, mg C m-2 d-1), bottom water dissolved oxygen concentration (µmol kg-1), pH, and potential temperature (°C) were downloaded from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) enterprise system. The epc100 was converted to export POC flux at the seafloor using the Martin curve (Martin, Knauer, Karl, & Broenkow, 1987) following the equation: epc = epc100*(water depth/export depth)-0.858, and setting the export depth to 100 m. Near seafloor aragonite (Ωar) and calcite (Ωcal) saturation were also used as candidate predictors for habitat suitability of cold-water coral species. These saturation states were computed by dividing the bottom water carbonate ion concentration (mol m-3) by the bottom water carbonate ion concentration (mol m-3) for seawater in equilibrium with pure aragonite and calcite. Yearly means of these parameters were calculated for the periods 1951-2000 (historical simulation) and 2081-2100 (RCP8.5 or business-as-usual scenario) using the average values obtained from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's ESM 2G model (GFDL-ESM-2G; Dunne et al., 2012), the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace's CM6-MR model (IPSL-CM5A-MR; Dufresne et al., 2013) and Max Planck Institute's ESM-MR model (MPI-ESM-MR; Giorgetta et al., 2013) within the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for each grid cell of the present study area.\n",

The layer is one of the 25 layers that make up the global seafloor geomorphic features map (Harris et.al. 2014). The continental rise was digitised by hand at a nominal spatial scale of 1:3,000,000 in ArcGIS based on 100 m contours.  A map of global ocean sediment thickness (Divins, 2003) was used to assist with identifying potential rise areas.  In general the rise was confined to areas of sediment thickness &gt;300 m. Criteria for identification of continental rises included the occurrence of a smooth sloping seabed as indicated by evenly-spaced, slope-parallel contours (Curray et al., 2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2008; Covault et al., 2011). In this study, the term “Rise” was restricted to features that abut continental margins and does not include the mid-ocean ridge (or “rise”), which was mapped as a separate feature.  The GEBCO Gazetteer of geographic names of undersea features (IHO-IOC, 2012) was used to ensure all named features were included.\n",

Near seafloor aragonite (Ωar) and calcite (Ωcal) saturation were also used as candidate predictors for habitat suitability of cold-water coral species. These saturation states were computed by dividing the bottom water carbonate ion concentration (mol m-3) by the bottom water carbonate ion concentration (mol m-3) for seawater in equilibrium with pure aragonite and calcite. Yearly means of these parameters were calculated for the periods 1951-2000 (historical simulation) and 2081-2100 (RCP8.5 or business-as-usual scenario) using the average values obtained from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's ESM 2G model (GFDL-ESM-2G; Dunne et al., 2012), the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace's CM6-MR model (IPSL-CM5A-MR; Dufresne et al., 2013) and Max Planck Institute's ESM-MR model (MPI-ESM-MR; Giorgetta et al., 2013) within the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for each grid cell of the present study area.\n",

      "The fan geomorphic feature layer represents the spatial extent of the fans of the worlds oceans based on interpretation of the SRTM30 plus v7 global bathymetry model. The layer is one of the 25 layers that make up the global seafloor geomorphic features map (Harris et.al. 2014). Fans are “a relatively smooth, fan-like, depositional feature normally sloping away from the outer termination of a canyon or canyon system” (IHO, 2008).  Since submarine fans are sediment deposits, the NGDC map of global ocean sediment thickness (Divins, 2003) was used to assist with identifying them.  Fans overlay and comprise part of the continental rise and are located offshore from the base of the continental slope (Curray et al., 2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2008; Covault et al., 2011).  Fans are inter-related with submarine canyons and sediment drift deposits; in cases where canyon axes extend across the rise, the canyon-channels may be flanked by sediment drift deposits, which have been grouped with fans in this study. Fans are defined in the present study by 100 m isobaths that form a concentric series exhibiting an expanding spacing in a seaward direction away from the base of the slope, sometimes clearly associated with a canyon mouth, but also comprising low-relief ridges between canyon-channels on the abyssal plain.\n",
